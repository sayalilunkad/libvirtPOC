# by OpenStack applications and related software running in the VMs.

# Note that the VM shell user and its password are not set here. By default,
# those are hard-coded in the preseed/kickstart files or in the Vagrant base
# box. The scripts get the shell user name from deploy.{osbash,vagrant} and
# don't need a password (they use password-less sudo and -- if configured --
# ssh keys).
