# At this point in the cluster build, we just rebooted the compute VM to take
# a snapshot, and we are about to reboot the controller node for the same
# purpose.
#
# About a minute after we reboot the controller, the status of nova-compute
# (according to nova-manage service list) becomes "XXX".
#
# If we sleep for 2 seconds now, before rebooting the controller, the
# nova-compute service on the compute node will keep running and the status
# will automatically return to ":-)" after some time (may take several
# minutes). If we don't sleep here, the nova-compute service on compute will
# die within a few minutes (needs manual service restart or a compute node
# reboot).
