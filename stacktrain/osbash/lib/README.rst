This directory contains bash libraries used by scripts.

Configuration files for kickstart (Fedora) and preseed (Ubuntu) are in
osbash/netboot.

The vagrant-ssh-keys from the Vagrant project can be automatically installed
into osbash VMs to make them accessible like Vagrant VMs without having
to install yet another set of ssh keys.

The templates used to build Windows batch files are in the wbatch subdirectory.
